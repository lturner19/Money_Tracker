# Money Tracker

<br>

## INTRODUCTION

As a budget conscious consumer I want an app that will allow me to track my expenses when I do and do not have access to internet.

<br>

## DESCRIPTION

A budget tracker that will allow users to keep track of their expenses while traveling around the world or simply traveling around town.  
If a user does not have access to internet services, the app will continue to keep track of all debits and credits and then update the app once a connection is re-established. 
The user can also visually track their expenses with the generated graph and a total is displayed above the transactions.
